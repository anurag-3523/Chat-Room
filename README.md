In Python language, socket (or network socket) is a module used to communicate between two computers. It provides two types of interface to access the network, namely low-level (platform dependent connections — Example: Telnet) and high-level (application dependent connections — Example: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, etc.)

I was establish the low-level socket connection between server and client to communicate messages using the TCP/IP protocol.
